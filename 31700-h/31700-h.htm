<h2>REFLECTIONS OF A<br />
BACHELOR GIRL</h2>


<div class='cap'>"JUST once more" is the Devil's best argument.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='cap'>VARIETY is the spice of love.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='cap'>THE only people who believe in a personal
devil, nowadays, are the ones who are
married to that kind.</div>

<div class='cap'>THE girl who marries for money is bought;
but the girl who marries for love is sold.</div>

<div class='cap'>A WISE lover, like a good cook, is one who
knows when the fire is out.</div>

<div class='cap'>ALIMONY is the price of peace.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='cap'>IN marriage, the love-light so often goes out
as soon as the gas bills begin to come in.</div></div>

<div class='cap'>THE only way to be happy with a husband
is to learn to be happy without him most
of the time.</div>

<div class='cap'>LOVE is just the shine on the jewel of
matrimony; but, after all, the shine on a
jewel is the whole thing.</div>

<div class='cap'>A MAN firmly believes that, if he can only
keep his wife in the straight and narrow
path, he can go out and zig-zag all over the
downward one without falling from grace.</div>

<div class='cap'>A GIRL is never so surprised when a man
proposes to her as he is.</div>

<div class='cap'>LOVE doesn't really "make the world go
'round," it only makes us so dizzy that
everything seems to be going round.</div>

<div class='cap'>ENNUI is "that tired feeling" that a girl
has when the right man doesn't show up
and the wrong one does.</div></div>

<div class='cap'>STRANGE, how joyfully a man will pay a
lawyer five hundred dollars for untying
the knot that he begrudged paying a clergyman
fifty dollars for tying.</div>

<div class='cap'>WHEN a girl marries, she exchanges the
attentions of all the other men of her
acquaintance for the inattention of just
one.</div>

<div class='cap'>IT gives a girl silver threads among the gold
to marry her ardent admirer and find out
afterward that she has tied herself to a
life-critic.</div>

<div class='cap'>AS FAR as men are concerned, a woman's
reputation for brains is worse than no
reputation at all.</div>

<div class='cap'>ALAS, if husbands were only like sewing
machines, and we could have them sent
up on trial!</div></div>

<div class='cap'>KISSING a girl, without first telling her
that you love her, is as small and mean as
letting a salesman take you for a free ride
in an automobile when you have no intention
of buying it.</div>

<div class='cap'>DIVORCE is the "Great Divide," over
which many men think they will pass into
Heaven.</div>

<div class='cap'>A MAN can never be made to understand
why a woman will pay fifty dollars for
a hat containing ten dollars worth of material
and forty dollars worth of style.</div>

<div class='cap'>YOUTH will be youth; a young man chases
temptation, folly, and chorus girls as naturally
as a kitten chases its tail.</div>

<div class='cap'>FLINGING yourself at a man's head is like
flinging a bone at a cat; it doesn't fascinate
him, it frightens him.</div></div>

<div class='cap'>MEN say they admire a woman with high
ideals and principles; but it's the kind
with high heels and dimples that a wife
hesitates to introduce to her husband.</div>

<div class='cap'>MARRIAGE is the black coffee that a man
takes to settle him after the love-feast.</div>

<div class='cap'>LOVE is the feeling that makes a man turn
on the hot water when he meant to light
the gas, go hunting for a collar when what
he wanted was a pair of socks, shave every
day, and forget whether or not he has had
any lunch.</div>

<div class='cap'>HAPPINESS is at high-tide at the full of
the honeymoon.</div>

<div class='cap'>SOMEHOW, a man who has been thrown
over always lands on his knees to another
girl.</div></div>

of love.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='cap'>IT IS difficult for an old horse to learn new
tricks&mdash;but an old <i>man</i> hasn't sense enough
not to try.</div>

<div class='cap'>THE tenderest spot in a man's make-up is
sometimes the bald spot on top of his
head.</div>

<div class='cap'>NEVER worry for fear you have broken a
man's heart; at the worst it is only
sprained and a week's rest will put it in
perfect working condition again.</div>

<div class='cap'>A RICH girl need not bother to cultivate
the art of conversation in order to be fascinating.
Her money will do the talking.</div></div>

with which men make love&mdash;in
novels&mdash;, except the off-hand commonplaceness
with which they do it in real life.</div>

<div class='cap'>ABOUT the only sign of personal individuality
that the average woman is allowed
to retain after she marries is her toothbrush.</div>

<div class='cap'>THERE are just three brands of masculine
affection: platonic, which is love without
kisses; plutonic, which is kisses without
love, and kisses WITH love&mdash;which is almost
extinct.</div>

<div class='cap'>OF course women should marry; no home
is complete without a husband any more
than it is without a cuckoo clock or a cat.</div>

grapes were the girls he couldn't kiss.</div>

<div class='cap'>A MAN'S desire for a son is usually nothing
but the wish to duplicate himself in order
that such a remarkable pattern may
not be lost to the world.</div>

<div class='cap'>IT isn't the girls whom he has loved and lost
that a man sighs for; it's those whom he
has loved and never won.</div>

<div class='cap'>LAZY men fancy that the wheel of life is a
roulette wheel, on which fortunes are won
only by chance.</div>

<div class='cap'>EVERY time a woman gives a man a piece

wife criticism and advice instead of
compliments, he forgets that it was not his
good judgment, but his charming manners,
that won her heart.</div>

<div class='cap'>A MAN never marries when he ought to; he
waits until some woman comes along
and gets him so tangled up that he has to.</div>

<div class='cap'>THE shortest way to Heaven or to Hell is
via the Love Route, Limited.</div>

<div class='cap'>IT MAY be bad form for a man to pay his
wife compliments and call her pet-names in
the presence of other women, but it's awfully
good policy.</div>

<div class='cap'>MANY a foolish runaway match has been
prevented by the fact that a girl didn't

<div class='cap'>HUSBANDS are like Christmas gifts: you
can't choose them; you've just got to sit
down and wait until they arrive and then
appear perfectly delighted with what you
get.</div>

<div class='cap'>THE beauty of variety in love or wine is
that the moment a man discovers a new
brand or a new girl, he forgets all about
the others and honestly believes that he is
tasting the real thing for the first time.</div>

<div class='cap'>MATRIMONY should not be a prison but
a privilege, and husbands and wives
should not be jailors but jolliers.</div>

<div class='cap'>THAT lump which a man feels in his throat
when he is about to propose is the "don't"

enough to avoid asking his wife a question
when her mouth is full of pins.</div>

<div class='cap'>THE oftener a man falls in love, the more
easily and gracefully he does it; exercise
seems to keep the heart in good working
condition.</div>

<div class='cap'>IT IS always a surprise to a woman when her
husband sues for $200,000 for the alienation
of her affections, which he never seemed
to consider worth two cents.</div>

<div class='cap'>MATRIMONY is a revolving door, round
which husband and wife follow one another
without ever meeting on the same
side of any question.</div>

<div class='cap'>THE woman who insists on playing Solitaire
in conversation is likely to end by
playing Old Maid.</div>

<div class='cap'>FROM the number of virtues and accomplishments
that a man expects to find in
one wife, you'd fancy he was marrying a
harem.</div>

<div class='cap'>DON'T worry for fear you may freeze a
man's love out; the colder the wind you
blow upon it, the higher you fan the
flames.</div>

qualms about flirting with a woman.</div>

<div class='cap'>THE woman who pins her faith to a man
won't find a safety-pin strong enough to
stand the strain.</div>

<div class='cap'>IN love, the best way to erase one face from
the tablet of memory is to draw another
across it.</div>

<div class='cap'>A MAN'S ideal woman is the one he

kiss from a nice girl&mdash;but it isn't until

as though they were writing for publication,
or fame, or posterity.</div>

<div class='cap'>THE man who breaks his social engagements
with you before marriage, will break
everything from his word to your heart,
afterward.</div>

<div class='cap'>PLATONIC friendship is a ship that starts
for Nowhere and nearly always ends by

<div class='cap'>THE saddest sight on earth is an old bachelor
trying to sew on a button with a blunt
needle and a piece of string.</div>

<div class='cap'>THERE are some men who, before marriage,
will risk their lives to pick up your

marriage to pick up anything you might

woman above all things, but they seldom

<div class='cap'>NOTHING bores a man worse than the devotion
of the girl before the last.</div>

<div class='cap'>IT'S rather sad to see how easily a man gets
"that tired feeling" after a love affair has
become a bit stale.</div>

<div class='cap'>A MAN may send you a gold-handled umbrella
with your monogram on it in diamonds
